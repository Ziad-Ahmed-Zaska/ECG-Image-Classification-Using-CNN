# ECG-Image-Classification-Using-CNN

The web app uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify ECG images into six different classes. The six classes are:

1.Fusion of ventricular and normal beat
2.Myocardial Infarction
3.Normal Beat
4.Premature Ventricular Contraction
5.Supraventricular Premature Beat
6.Unclassifiable Beat

The CNN model is trained to learn patterns and features in the ECG images that are associated with each of these classes.
The app takes an ECG image as input, preprocesses it, passes it through the trained CNN model, and predicts the class label of the input ECG image based on the learned features and patterns in the image.
The predicted class label and confidence level are then displayed as the output of the app.

# To run the app

Run the Flask app by running the "app.py" file which is located in the "App Source Code" folder.
Open a web browser and go to the address "http://localhost:5000/" to access the home page of the web app.
